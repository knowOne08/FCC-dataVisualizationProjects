<!-- In D3, there are scales to help plot data. scales are functions that tell the program how to map a set of raw data points onto the pixels of the SVG canvas. -->
<!-- D3 has several scale types. For a linear scale (usually used with quantitative data), there is the D3 method scaleLinear(): -->
<!-- By default, a scale uses the identity relationship. The value of the input is the same as the value of the output. A separate challenge covers how to change this. -->
