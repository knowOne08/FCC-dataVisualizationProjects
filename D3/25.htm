<!-- By default, scales use the identity relationship. This means the input value maps to the output value. However, scales can be much more flexible and interesting. -->
<!-- Say a dataset has values ranging from 50 to 480. This is the input information for a scale, also known as the domain. -->
<!-- You want to map those points along the x axis on the SVG canvas, between 10 units and 500 units. This is the output information, also known as the range. -->
<!-- The domain() and range() methods set these values for the scale. Both methods take an array of at least two elements as an argument. Here's an example: -->
<body>
    <script>
      // Add your code below this line
      const scale = d3.scaleLinear();
      scale.domain([250, 500]);
      scale.range([10, 150]);
  
  
      // Add your code above this line
      const output = scale(50);
      d3.select("body")
        .append("h2")
        .text(output);
    </script>
  </body>
